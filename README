#FastBlocks v 0.01
==================

FastBlock is a Tetris game written object-oriented in Python 2.6 with help of the pygame library.
You can see a Screenshot of the actual game in images/screenshot.jpg
I used only the pygame examples, the internet and a bit of my grey cells to create the code ;)
maybe somedays it will be used for a tutorial, because I'm on the way to deal with game programming
