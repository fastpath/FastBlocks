# FastBlocks v 0.01

FastBlock is a simple Tetris game written in Python. It's my first try at developing a game completely
by myself and that's just the beginning. It's freeware and opensource under github. (see Contact below)

## Special Features:
- Customization by a XML-Config file
	- Create your own blocks!
	- Choose your own background image!
- different speed levels (increasing after 90 seconds)

## Requirements and how to get started:
If you have or want to get Python (www.python.org):
- the game was developed with version 2.5.4 (32-Bit)
- pygame 1.9.1 is required
- to run the game type in your terminal from this folder "python fastblocks.py" and you're ready! :)

If you don't have Python, but Windows:
- try to start fastblocks.exe from the ./dist subfolder and have fun! :)
